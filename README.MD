# The-Great-Heist
TheGreatHeist - a VR game for "Google Cardboard". (Created by Till Roßberg at the HTW, 2018)
How to use: Unfortunately it is quite difficult to install an application that was not downloaded from the Google
Play Store on your Android phone.
1. Attach your Android device via USB to your PC.
2. Copy the „TheGreatHeist.apk“ to your Android device, e.g. the download folder.
3. In this wiki you will find a description how to access the file: https://www.wikihow.tech/Install-
APK-Files-on-Android . (In the second part skip to step 5, because you already have copied the
*.apk to your device.)
Hopefully it all works!
Enjoy! :)
